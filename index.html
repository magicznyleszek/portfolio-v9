<section gui-pageSection="short">
    The three values closest to my heart are: simplicity, order and meaning. I design and build systems of various complexity, either via frontend code or graphical handmakings. My *artistic side* [sic] is brought to light when I draw and illustrate stuff. As I fear for the future of humanity, and don't want to throw more senseless evil out there, I try to take part only in meaningful, nature- and future-friendly projects.
