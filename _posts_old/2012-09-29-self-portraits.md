A first series of concrete drawings of the heads of Leszek. The proposal that stems from them is that the heads from the head are worse than the heads from the mirror -- which of course doesn't mean that I will come to my senses and will use this advice... The last one is by far the closest one physically, but somehow lacking psychologically.

The second series of portraits of Leszek. This time more hipsterish and on the subject -- still fun with a mixture of techniques. Supposedly some of them are perfectly on the spot, and the others quite funny -- unfortunately I do not know, which are which.
