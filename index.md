I'm a cool-headed helpful unicorn.

I'm a unicorn. I don't give into stress easily, or believe in conflicts. I love teamwork.

Internet calls a person who can code and design "a unicorn". But I can also draw and write, so I guess "alicorn" is more accurate term :-)

The three values closest to my heart are: simplicity, order and meaning. I design and build systems of various complexity, either via frontend code or graphical handmakings. My _artistic side_ [sic] is brought to light when I draw and illustrate stuff.

As I fear for the future of humanity, and don't want to throw more senseless evil out there, I try to take part only in meaningful, nature- and future-friendly projects.
