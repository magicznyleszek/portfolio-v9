### TW3
I was in a team responsible for the activation process of the game. You see, the game boxes sold had cd with 99% game files and Galaxy client installer. You could buy the game before release and then on release date only a tiny patch was released that made the game working. This means that we had to be completely sure the process will not fail. TW3 is a really heavy game (~40GB) and having it playable on day one was really important.
In my team I was responsible for frontend part of galaxy
