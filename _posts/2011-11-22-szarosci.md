Abstracts for mister Norbert Skupniewicz -- a former boxer, a former sailor, a somehow renowned painter and current teacher of arts, that tries to win over time with the help of oil paintings. These four drawings so tough for sure are not, even with the help of Duchamp and solid ink with a fish logo on the label. Internet is my chance for the everlasting -- I heard that it ensures immortality for free (but with ads).
