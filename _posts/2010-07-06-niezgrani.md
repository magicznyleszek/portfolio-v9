The hat of Indiana Jones, the moustache of Mario and the look of Dirty Harry. What more could you wish for to get the 70s and 80s climate, when the games began to conquer the hearts of the players? Maybe a little life bar? The cowboy may not be the best shooter in the Wild West, he may not have extensive land properties, he may also got beat up sometimes -- but he always come out on top. He is determined, resourceful and up to the task. He goes by his own paths and doesn't submit to anyone. He has his own opinion. And a cigarette in the mouth as a sign of maturity.
