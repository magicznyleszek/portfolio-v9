A collection of several mockups for websites.

[Small game-site for Christmas](http://www.closbrothers.pl/wesolych-swiat-2013/) as a part of work in [Clos Brothers](http://closbrothers.pl). Everything has been designed modularly in individual `.ai` files, so that it was easier to keep order in the main file. The obvious influence of the frontend-development methodologies on the graphical work. Since the beginning of the creation the project was on my head, so all `HTML`, `CSS`, and most `JavaScript` (Johny wrote the game part) is my merit.

A refreshment project for [Polish Convention Bureau](http://www.poland-convention.pl/) with mobile devices taken into account and a migration to the new version of Joomla (bleh), which -- after coding the whole page -- for unknown corporate reasons has not been updated on the production environment.

A project for [Instytut Psychoanalizy i Psychoterapii](http://www.ipp.waw.pl/) during my stay at [Trewebs](http://trewebs.com), implemented by the intern at Trewebs.

And a small business site that didn't manage to start.
