I take ~~writing~~ crafting code as something strongly philosophical -- organizing and categorizing thoughts, constant falsification, and optimization in search of the ideal. A meditative process that subconsciously enriches other parts of my life. Besides, I can make all kind of different shit come to life for others to experience <3.
