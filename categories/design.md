To make design you will need:

1. Detective research from CSI: Design
2. Doodling like cray cray
3. Evolutionary math
4. Pretending being someone else
5. Chemical X

Building these minimalistic messages that don't need words to be understood is very fulfilling. And you can theoretically fight the forces of evil with that.
