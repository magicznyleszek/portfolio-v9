description: Useless analog and digital drawings for no one.

I love black ink, unnamed textures and living organisms. In real world I seek realism, but on paper the truth is much more interesting. My mission is to describe only the essences of things, so besides using my eyes, I gather all non-visual feelings with my mind. I am trying not to try, in hope of achieving true images.

I am digital-curious, but analog is superior in 96% cases.
