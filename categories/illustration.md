description: Useless analog and digital drawings for no one.

I love black ink, unnamed textures and living organisms. In real world, I seek realism, but on paper, the truth is much, much more interesting. That is why I try to describe only the essences of things. Using my eyes (obviously), I also gather all non-visual feelings with my mind. And finally, trying not to try, I hope to achieve true images. I do digital, but analog is superior 87% of time.
