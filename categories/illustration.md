I love black ink, unnamed textures and living organisms. In real world, I seek realism, but on paper, the truth is much, much more interesting. That is why I try to describe only the essences of things. I use my eyes obviously, but I also gather all non-visual feelings with my mind. With mixing those, I hope to achieve true images.
