description: Useless analog and digital drawings for no one.

I love black ink, unnamed textures and living organisms. In real world, I seek realism, but on paper, the truth is much, much more interesting. That is why I try to describe only the essences of things. So besides using my eyes, I gather all non-visual feelings with my mind. In the end, trying not to try, I hope to achieve true images.

I am digital-curious, but analog is superior 87% of time.
