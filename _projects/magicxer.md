Magical words mixer. Combines words from list into a list of clever mixes. You can check it out live at [magicxer.smutnyleszek.com](http://magicxer.smutnyleszek.com).

It also has some code for splitting words to syllables -- simple but imperfect solution for a surprisingly complex problem.

Apart from writing the code, I've also built the visual side.

I designed it 100% in the browser using the best web design tool out there: Dev Tools. It is a simple tool, so the layout had to be simple. Whole thing scales perfectly and is screen size agnostic. Usability is the queen.

After settling on a color scheme and overall layout I drew a logo.

It is also released as an NPM module, my first one ðŸ¤˜.
