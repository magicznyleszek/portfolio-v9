"Portret trumienny" is the debut novel of Kuba Wojtaszczyk ([interview with Milena Buszkiewicz for Booklips -- in polish](http://booklips.pl/wywiady/polski-portret-wywiad-z-kuba-wojtaszczykiem/)), a young, promising writer and cultural studies graduate. Originally I was comissioned for few illustrations, but I ended up creating the cover, designing and preparing the whole book for print and virtually the entire visual stuff related to the book. The novel was self-published in small quantity.

- cover

Color-wise I wanted to juxtapose the traditional coffin portrait with a very non-rural and non-Polish color with a cultural/artistic character -- a persian green. Additionally I went with two complementary colors.

- palette

After reading the text I had a long list of ideas -- I decided to go with seven of them, but after some thinking with Kuba, we rejected one, too controversial concept. For a clearer overview we added a non-architectural plan of the house at the end of the book.

The main inspiration for me was the visual legacy of the Catholic Church and a provincional design rooted in the PRL.

The fonts in the book are *Chaparral Pro* from Carol Twombly and *Halis Rounded* from Ahmet Altun. Due to a small size, the text is placed within a relatively simple grid with chapters beginning on new pages, subsections separated by `&bullet;`s and blank backs for illustrations.

You will most likely get a new copy of the book after a short walk to one of Warsaw's bookstore: Pępek Sztuki, Super Salon, Bookoff or Baczyński. But I can't promise anything.
