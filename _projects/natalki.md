Some drawings -- at least six of them (from "D" to "H" plus "K") -- are missing and I don't remember what was on them. The thing I do remember is borrowing them to my collage professor [Izabela Gustowska](http://www.gustowska.com/), as she promised to display them on some exhibition. But my memory is POS, so I guess I am to blame for being forgetful.
