Identity design for a nonexisting self-made-up philosophical tattoo studio **überink** -- as a part of the thesis written under the guidance of [Wojtek Janicki](http://gobranding.eu/). Graphical stuff was accompanied by a short essay written on the subject: ["Tatuaż jako sztuka wizualna"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/uberink-historia-tatuazu.pdf).

Main sign is constructed of a triangle, vertical line and a circle. I could write that from a mundane horizon, in a perfect triangle of opportunities, there grows the desire to perfect sense -- but in fact, this is a figure that crystallized itself while I read some philosophical essays, listened to [podcasts](http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/) and walked around the neighborhood at night.

For a main identity font I chose a beautiful and simple Halis Rounded by [Ahmet Altun](http://www.aatype.net/), bought on an annual christmas sale at MyFonts.

Following a restricted pallete of verticals, horizontals, diagonals and circles, I made a nice set of 25 icons in five basic kinda-themed groups:

- nature
- deus
- science
- intimacy
- death

These icons can be used individually, but their main taks is to populate a classic, old-school pattern of stars and dots -- which fills the space between the illustrations/tattoos.

In the meantime, in parallel -- though not in a parallel world -- I was collecting some visual inspirations, making notes on the lives of the philospophers and sketched out their thoughts. I like order, so for each of the arbitrarily selected and the most important thinkers of our-my world I approached with [the same manner]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/uberink-process-parts.gif) and in chronological order.

The outcome of the hard work are 12 illustrations -- or rather tattoos -- depicting a cross section through the human thought from the year -624 in ancient Greece to modern times. The last of the apostles of überink is a very lively professor from Yale.

The final use of the combined forces of illustration and the identity is mainly intended for a large areas of vertical space filled with clean pattern surrounding a big drawings of philosophers.

In practice, this is only a theoretical project -- but maybe someday in the future, I will set up a tattoo studio, and then I will dust off those dust-proof files and expand them to meet their final destination.
