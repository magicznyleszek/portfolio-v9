This is a story on how a logo design job can go really bad :-D

I was contracted to design a unique logo for a company that used a free icon until then.

A quote from [Freemix website](http://freemix.com) should explain best what it's all about:

> Freemix is a free image collage and remix tool
> We built it to make creative expression fun, easy, and free to all.

AFAIK the app is still running as of 2018, but seems to be dead since second half of 2016.
