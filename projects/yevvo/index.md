Yevvo, Air, Meerkat, Houseparty

> In August the company — whose actual name is Life on Air — went back to the drawing board. It wasn’t the first time — the company had previously built Yevvo, an earlier take on broadcasting that focused on locations; and Air, an app for live streaming between friends. After Yevvo became a ghost town, the team hacked together Meerkat in eight weeks. Its success gave them another chance — but now the ground was falling out from underneath them again.

Yevvo was a live broadcasting app. Devs took it's best parts and transformed into Air

Yevvo passed away unfortunately https://twitter.com/yevvo
