    Maybe there was something here, or maybe it's only a simple misunderstanding. It would be best for all of us, if you go back to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">home page</a> and continue from there.

    Or if you have a while, go and see <a href="http://www.nationearth.com/" target="_blank">Shaun Monson's documentary about humans</a>.
